* Link Pages is used in case you have posts that are set to break into

*
* Also, breaking content up into multiple pages is a horrible experience,
* so don't do it. While there are SOME edge cases where this is useful, it's
* mostly used for people to get more ad views. It's up to you but if you want
* to do it, you're wrong and I hate you. (Ok, I still love you but just not as much)
